# Google Book Search


# Overview
In this activity, I create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This app construction used React components, helper/util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
